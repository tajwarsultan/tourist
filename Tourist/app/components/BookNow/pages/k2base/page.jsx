              to the Art Gilkey Memorial (an American geologist and mountaineer)
              just before K2 Base Camp. This is a long, but spectacular day.

              We will depart early, crossing glaciers onto a faint trail leading
              towards K2. As we follow the glacier, K2 will grow larger with
              each step. Broad Peak rises to the right, and after about 3 hours,
              we will pass Broad Peak Base Camp, where there is an option to
              turn back. We usually stop here for lunch. For those continuing,
              K2 will tower above as we approach it.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
              Just before reaching base camp, we will visit the Art Gilkey
              Memorial, a place of remembrance for those whose lives K2 has
              claimed. The memorial is located amidst a boulder-strewn
              landscape, and a short scramble leads to plaques and engraved tin
              plates attached to a rocky outcrop at the foot of K2. We will have
              lunch here before retracing our steps back to Concordia.
